# Stakeholders

We interviewed two NYU students: Anthony and Will. Both will be living off-campus for their second year this year. Both live with friends they met before moving in. From their independent interviews, we identified the following:

Problems/frustrations:
- Limited social reach: It's difficult to find roommates who aren't your friends (or friends of friends), classmates, etc. It's all just by word of mouth, which largely narrows down the pool of potential roommates. There are so many people in search of roommates but there is no efficient way (to our knowledge) of connecting them.
- Efficiency: Finding roommates can take a lot of time and effort, and there is no streamlined process.
- Compatibility: Even if you are able to find someone, the odds of sharing living preferences/styles aren't high
- Getting to know them: Even if you are able to find someone, there is no natural encouragement/facilitation of getting to know each other before starting to live together. This can increase the chances of unforseeable tension, awkward situations, etc.

Goals/needs:
- A vehicle to facilitate finding potential roommates beyond the scope of one's regular social circles
- Finding roommates who share apartment goals (budget, location, etc.)
- Matching/filtering roommates based on compatibility
- The opportunity to get to know potential roommates before agreeing to live with them
- Overall, an efficient, streamlined process of the above to make the entire apartment/roommate hunt less daunting

## Product Vision Statement

# Stakeholders

We interviewed two NYU students: Anthony and Will. Both will be living off-campus for their second year this year. Both live with friends.

Goals/needs:
- A vehicle to facilitate finding potential roommates beyond the scope of their regular social circles
- Finding roommates who share their apartment goals (budget, location, etc.)
- Finding roommates with whom they're compatible
- Getting to know potential roommates before agreeing to live with them
- An efficient, streamlined process of the above

Problems/frustrations:
- Limited social reach: It's difficult to find roommates who aren't your friends (or friends of friends), classmates, etc. It's all just by word of mouth, which largely narrows down the pool of potential roommates. There are so many people in search of roommates but there is no efficient way (to our knowledge) of connecting them.
- Efficiency: Finding roommates can take a lot of time and effort, and there is no streamlined process.
- Compatibility: Even if you are able to find someone, the odds of sharing living preferences/styles aren't high
- Getting to know them: Even if you are able to find someone, there is no natural encouragement/facilitation of getting to know each other before starting to live together. This can create tension, awkward situations, etc.

## Product Vision Statement
